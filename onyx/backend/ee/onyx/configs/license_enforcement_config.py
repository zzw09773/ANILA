"""Constants for license enforcement.

This file is the single source of truth for:
1. Paths that bypass license enforcement (always accessible)
2. Paths that require an EE license (EE-only features)

Import these constants in both production code and tests to ensure consistency.
"""

# Paths that are ALWAYS accessible, even when license is expired/gated.
# These enable users to:
#   /auth - Log in/out (users can't fix billing if locked out of auth)
#   /license - Fetch, upload, or check license status
#   /health - Health checks for load balancers/orchestrators
#   /me - Basic user info needed for UI rendering
#   /settings, /enterprise-settings - View app status and branding
#   /billing - Unified billing API
#   /proxy - Self-hosted proxy endpoints (have own license-based auth)
#   /tenants/billing-* - Legacy billing endpoints (backwards compatibility)
#   /manage/users, /users - User management (needed for seat limit resolution)
#   /notifications - Needed for UI to load properly
