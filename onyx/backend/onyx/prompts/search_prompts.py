# How it works and rationale:
# First - this works best empirically across multiple LLMs, some of this is back-explaining reasons based on results.
#
# The system prompt is kept simple and as similar to typical system prompts as possible to stay within training distribution.
# The history is passed through as a list of messages, this should allow the LLM to more easily understand what is going on.
# The special tokens and separators let the LLM more easily disregard no longer relevant past messages.
# The last message is dynamically created and has a detailed description of the actual task.
# This is based on the assumption that users give much more varied requests in their prompts and LLMs are well adjusted to this.
# The proximity of the instructions and the lack of any breaks should also let the LLM follow the task more clearly.
#
# For document verification, the history is not included as the queries should ideally be standalone enough.
# To keep it simple, it is just a single simple prompt.


SEMANTIC_QUERY_REPHRASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an assistant that reformulates the last user message into a standalone, self-contained query suitable for \
semantic search. Your goal is to output a single natural language query that captures the full meaning of the user's \
most recent message. It should be fully semantic and natural language unless the user query is already a keyword query. \

SEMANTIC_QUERY_REPHRASE_USER_PROMPT = """
Given the chat history above (if any) and the final user query (provided below), provide a standalone query that is as
representative of the user query as possible. In most cases, it should be exactly the same as the last user query. \
It should be fully semantic and natural language unless the user query is already a keyword query. \
Focus on the last user message, in most cases the history and extra context should be ignored.

For a query like "What are the use cases for product X", your output should remain "What are the use cases for product X". \
It should remain semantic, and as close to the original query as possible. There is nothing additional needed \
from the history or that should be removed / replaced from the query.

For modifications, you can:
1. Insert relevant context from the chat history. For example:
"How do I set it up?" -> "How do I set up software Y?" (assuming the conversation was about software Y)

2. Remove asks or requests not related to the searching. For example:
"Can you summarize the calls with example company" -> "calls with example company"
"Can you find me the document that goes over all of the software to set up on an engineer's first day?" -> \
"all of the software to set up on an engineer's first day"

3. Fill in relevant information about the user. For example:
"What document did I write last week?" -> "What document did John Doe write last week?" (assuming the user is John Doe)

- Choose sections most relevant to answering the query, if at all in doubt, include the section.
- Even if only a tiny part of the section is relevant, include it.
- It is ok to select multiple sections from the same document.
- Consider indirect connections and supporting context to be valuable.
- If the section is not directly helpful but the document seems relevant, there is an opportunity \
later to expand the section and read more from the document so include the section.

Analyze the relevance of document sections to a search query and classify according to the categories \

# Document Title / Metadata
```
{document_title}

# Section Above:

```

# Main Section:
```
{main_section}
```

# Section Below:
```
{section_below}
```

# User Query:
```

```

# Classification Categories:
**0 - NOT_RELEVANT**
- Main section and surrounding sections do not help answer the query or provide meaningful, relevant information.
- Appears on topic but refers to a different context or subject (could lead to potential confusion or misdirection). \
It is important to avoid conflating different contexts and subjects - if the document is related to the query but not about \
the correct subject. Example: "How much did we quote ACME for project X", "ACME paid us $100,000 for project Y".

**1 - MAIN_SECTION_ONLY**
- Main section contains useful information relevant to the query.
- Adjacent sections do not provide additional directly relevant information.

**2 - INCLUDE_ADJACENT_SECTIONS**
- The main section AND adjacent sections are all useful for answering the user query.
- The surrounding sections provide relevant information that does not exist in the main section.
- Even if only 1 of the adjacent sections is useful or there is a small piece in either that is useful.
- Additional unseen sections are unlikely to contain valuable related information.

**3 - INCLUDE_FULL_DOCUMENT**
- Additional unseen sections are likely to contain valuable related information to the query.

## Additional Decision Notes
- If only a small piece of the document is useful - use classification 1 or 2, do not use 0.
- If the document is on topic and provides additional context that might be useful in \
combination with other documents - use classification 1, 2 or 3, do not use 0.

CRITICAL: ONLY output the NUMBER of the situation most applicable to the query and sections provided (0, 1, 2, or 3).
