"""Inverse mapping from user-facing Microsoft host URLs to the SDK's AzureEnvironment.

The office365 library's GraphClient requires an ``AzureEnvironment`` string
(e.g. ``"Global"``, ``"GCC High"``) to route requests to the correct national
cloud.  Our connectors instead expose free-text ``authority_host`` and
``graph_api_host`` fields so the frontend doesn't need to know about SDK
internals.

This module bridges the gap: given the two host URLs the user configured, it
resolves the matching ``AzureEnvironment`` value (and the implied SharePoint
domain suffix) so callers can pass ``environment=…`` to ``GraphClient``.
