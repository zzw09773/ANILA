    Call site: inside handle_stream_message_objects() in
    backend/onyx/chat/process_message.py, immediately after message_text is
    assigned from the request and before create_new_chat_message() saves it.

    This is the earliest possible point in the query pipeline:
    - Raw query — unmodified, exactly as the user typed it
    - No side effects yet — message has not been saved to DB
    - User identity is available for user-specific logic

    Supported use cases:
    - Query rejection: block queries based on content or user context
    - Query rewriting: normalize, expand, or modify the query
    - PII removal: scrub sensitive data before the LLM sees it
    - Access control: reject queries from certain users or groups
    - Query auditing: log or track queries based on business rules
