# Tasks are expected to cease execution and do cleanup after the soft time
# limit. In principle they are also forceably terminated after the hard time
# limit, in practice this does not happen since we use threadpools for Celery
# task execution, and we simple hope that the total task time plus cleanup does
# not exceed this. Therefore tasks should regularly check their timeout and lock
# status. The lock timeout is the maximum time the lock manager (Redis in this
# case) will enforce the lock, independent of what is happening in the task. To
# reduce the chances that a task is still doing work while a lock has expired,
# make the lock timeout well above the task timeouts. In practice we should
# never see locks be held for this long anyway because a task should release the
# lock after its cleanup which happens at most after its soft timeout.
