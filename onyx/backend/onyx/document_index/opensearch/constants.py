# per query. Imagine a simple case with a single keyword query and a single
# vector query and we want 10 final docs. If we only fetch 10 candidates from
# each of keyword and vector, they would have to have perfect overlap to get a
# good hybrid ranking for the 10 results. If we fetch 1000 candidates from each,
# we have a much higher chance of all 10 of the final desired docs showing up
# and getting scored. In worse situations, the final 10 docs don't even show up
# as the final 10 (worse than just a miss at the reranking step).
