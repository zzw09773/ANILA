# Vector DB Filter Semantics

How `IndexFilters` fields combine into the final query filter. Applies to both Vespa and OpenSearch.

## Filter categories

| Category | Fields | Join logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Visibility** | `hidden` | Always applied (unless `include_hidden`) |
| **Tenant** | `tenant_id` | AND (multi-tenant only) |
| **ACL** | `access_control_list` | OR within, AND with rest |
| **Narrowing** | `source_type`, `tags`, `time_cutoff` | Each OR within, AND with rest |
| **Knowledge scope** | `document_set`, `attached_document_ids`, `hierarchy_node_ids`, `persona_id_filter` | OR within group, AND with rest |
| **Additive scope** | `project_id_filter` | OR'd into knowledge scope **only when** a knowledge scope filter already exists |

## How filters combine

All categories are AND'd together. Within the knowledge scope category, individual filters are OR'd.

```
NOT hidden
AND tenant = T                          -- if multi-tenant
AND (acl contains A1 OR acl contains A2)
AND (source_type = S1 OR ...)           -- if set
AND (tag = T1 OR ...)                   -- if set
AND <knowledge scope>                   -- see below
AND time >= cutoff                      -- if set
```

## Knowledge scope rules

The knowledge scope filter controls **what knowledge an assistant can access**.

### Primary vs additive triggers

- **`persona_id_filter`** is a **primary** trigger. A persona with user files IS explicit
  knowledge, so `persona_id_filter` alone can start a knowledge scope. Note: this is
  NOT the raw ID of the persona being used — it is only set when the persona's
  user files overflowed the LLM context window.
- **`project_id_filter`** is **additive**. It widens an existing scope to include project
  files but never restricts on its own — a chat inside a project should still search
  team knowledge when no other knowledge is attached.

### No explicit knowledge attached

When `document_set`, `attached_document_ids`, `hierarchy_node_ids`, and `persona_id_filter` are all empty/None:

- **No knowledge scope filter is applied.** The assistant can see everything (subject to ACL).
- `project_id_filter` is ignored — it never restricts on its own.

### One explicit knowledge type

```
-- Only document sets
AND (document_sets contains "Engineering" OR document_sets contains "Legal")

-- Only persona user files (overflowed context)
AND (personas contains 42)
```

### Multiple explicit knowledge types (OR'd)

```
-- Document sets + persona user files
AND (
    document_sets contains "Engineering"
    OR personas contains 42
)
```

### Explicit knowledge + overflowing project files

When an explicit knowledge restriction is in effect **and** `project_id_filter` is set (project files overflowed the LLM context window), `project_id_filter` widens the filter:

```
-- Document sets + project files overflowed
AND (
    document_sets contains "Engineering"
    OR user_project contains 7
)

-- Persona user files + project files (won't happen in practice;
-- custom personas ignore project files per the precedence rule)
AND (
    personas contains 42
    OR user_project contains 7
)
```

### Only project_id_filter (no explicit knowledge)

No knowledge scope filter. The assistant searches everything.

```
-- Just ACL, no restriction
NOT hidden
AND (acl contains ...)
```
