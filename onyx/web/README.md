This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install node / npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
Install all dependencies: `npm i`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

_Note:_ if you are having problems accessing the ^, try setting the `WEB_DOMAIN` env variable to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000` and accessing it there.

> [!TIP]
> Packages are installed automatically when switching branches after `package.json` changes with [pre-commit](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#formatting-and-linting) configured.

### Connecting to a Cloud Backend

To test your local frontend development server against a cloud backend (e.g., staging or production),
create a `.env.local` file in the `web/` directory with the following configuration:

```text
# Point local dev server to cloud backend
INTERNAL_URL=https://st-dev.onyx.app/api

# Debug auth cookie for authenticating against remote backend
# This cookie is automatically injected into API requests when in development mode
# To get this value:
#   1. Go to https://st-dev.onyx.app (or your target backend URL) and log in
#   2. Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Cookies → [your backend domain]
#   3. Find the "fastapiusersauth" cookie and copy its value
#   4. Paste the value below (without quotes)
# Note: This cookie may expire, so you may need to refresh it periodically
DEBUG_AUTH_COOKIE=your_cookie_value_here
```

By default, this does _NOT_ override existing cookies, so if you've logged in previously, you
may need to delete the cookies for the `localhost` domain.

**Important notes:**

- The `.env.local` file should be created in the `web/` directory (same level as `package.json`)
- After creating or modifying `.env.local`, restart your development server for changes to take effect
- The `DEBUG_AUTH_COOKIE` is only used in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`)
- If `INTERNAL_URL` is not set, the frontend will connect to the local backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Keep your `.env.local` file secure and never commit it to version control (it should already be in `.gitignore`)

## Testing

This testing process will reset your application into a clean state.
Don't run these tests if you don't want to do this!

Bring up the entire application.

0. Install playwright dependencies

```bash
npx playwright install
```

1. Run playwright

```bash
npx playwright test
```

To run a single test:

```bash
npx playwright test landing-page.spec.ts
```

If running locally, interactive options can help you see exactly what is happening in
the test.

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
npx playwright test --headed
```

2. Inspect results

By default, playwright.config.ts is configured to output the results to:

```bash
web/output/playwright/
```

3. Visual regression screenshots

Screenshots are captured automatically during test runs and saved to `web/output/screenshots/`.
To compare screenshots across CI runs, use:

```bash
ods screenshot-diff compare --project admin
```

For more information, see [tools/ods/README.md](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/tools/ods/README.md#screenshot-diff---visual-regression-testing).
